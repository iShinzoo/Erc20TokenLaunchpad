# Token Launchpad Project

This project implements a decentralized token launchpad platform using Hardhat and Solidity. It allows users to create, buy, and sell ERC20 tokens in a decentralized manner.

## Project Overview

The platform consists of three main components:
- A token factory for creating new ERC20 tokens
- A launchpad for listing and trading tokens
- Administrative functions for managing the platform

### Key Features

- Create custom ERC20 tokens with configurable parameters
- List tokens on the launchpad with custom pricing
- Buy and sell tokens using ETH
- Administrative controls for token price updates and platform management

## Technical Stack

- Solidity ^0.8.28
- Hardhat Development Environment
- OpenZeppelin Contracts v5.3.0
- Hardhat Ignition for deployments
- Hardhat Toolbox for testing and development

## Smart Contracts

### TokenLaunchpad.sol
The main contract that handles:
- Token creation and listing
- Token buying and selling functionality
- Price management
- Platform administration

### Token.sol
A customizable ERC20 token contract that:
- Implements the ERC20 standard
- Allows configuration of name, symbol, and initial supply
- Inherits from OpenZeppelin's ERC20 implementation

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
```shell
npm install
```

2. Run tests:
```shell
npx hardhat test
```

3. Start local node:
```shell
npx hardhat node
```

4. Deploy contracts:
```shell
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/TokenLaunchpad.js
```

## Development Commands

```shell
# Get help and available commands
npx hardhat help

# Run tests
npx hardhat test

# Run tests with gas reporting
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test

# Start local blockchain node
npx hardhat node

# Deploy contracts using Ignition
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/TokenLaunchpad.js
```

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive test suites for all major functionality:
- Token creation and deployment
- Buying and selling mechanisms
- Administrative functions
- Access control
- Error handling

Run the test suite with:
```shell
npx hardhat test
```

## Security Features

- Ownership controls using OpenZeppelin's Ownable
- Safe math operations (built into Solidity ^0.8.0)
- Input validation and error handling
- Access control for administrative functions
